# XHR (XMLHttpRequest)

Learning XHR provides a deeper understanding of how web applications communicate with servers. This knowledge is invaluable when learning newer technologies, as it gives you a comprehensive view of client-server interaction in web development. In this I had used XHR for making get and post request. And the UI is completely responsive for all screensize.
